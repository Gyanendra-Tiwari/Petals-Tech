## Built with React + Vite

This project is based on React and Vite for fast development with hot module reload (HMR) support.

Currently, two official plugins are used:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) â€“ Uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) â€“ Uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## ESLint Configuration (Optional)

If you plan to scale the app for production, consider enabling type-aware lint rules using TypeScript.  
You can refer to the [React + TS Vite Template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for setup details.
